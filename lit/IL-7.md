# IL-7

## The role of IL-7 in Immunity and Cancer
[source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28314253/)

### Overall
main effects on T-cells and B-cells
necessary for both B-cell and T-cell proliferation
lack of IL-7 causes immature immune cell arrest
it might have direct or indirect effect on cancer

IL-2 superfamily:  IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21

binds to receptors with a common γ chain subunit
the receptor for IL-7 (IL-7R) requires an IL-7R α chain in order for binding to take place

IL-7–receptor binding results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor
	-> activation of JAK1 or JAK3 depending on the cell type
		-> activates: STAT5a/b, PI3 Kinase, and SRC kinases

play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neoplasia

### The Role of IL-7 in the Development of B-cells
	there seems to be some relation between IL-7 and the pre-B-cell receptor in the survival, proliferation and differentiation of B-cells
		current models demonstrate IL-7 not being required for human B-cell development (11) despite its necessity in mice models

	CD95+ B lymphocytes generally are associated with HIV1 infection
		it appears that IL-7 induces the apoptosis of these CD95+ B-cells
		IL-7 also appears to stunt B-cell maturation in HIV infected patients

	Human pre-B-cells do have IL-7 receptors and respond to IL-7 when presented in the presence of stromal cells

	IL-7 can act as a trophic factor in many developing B-cells
		IL-7 also works with stromal derived factor1 (SDF1), stem cell factor (SCF), and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3LG) in order to regulate B-cell development

	Mature B-cells are usually unable to respond to IL-7
		however, a small group of peripheral B-cells have been shown to be responsive

		In vitro studies have demonstrated that B-cell receptor antigen diversity occurs during development, but further changes can happen, and are controlled by recombinase-activating genes

		Oddly enough, in vitro generation of B-cells did not require IL-7 at all, despite the overwhelming amount of evidence that IL-7 is required for B-cell maturation in vivo

### The Role of IL-7 in the Development of T-cells
	T-cell development occurs through several stages in the thymus.

	Immature T-cells need to reach sufficient levels because their development has several stages known as positive and negative selection, contributing to the loss of 98% of T-cells

	triple negative precursors migrate into the thymus where they mature

	 As they mature, they go through the cortex into the medulla, and it is from here that the single positive T-cells leave to enter the circulation.

	 The thymus is the primary location of T-cell production although T-cells have also been shown to develop in the intestine, aided by IL-7

	 Where regulation of human T cell maturation was achieved by decreasing IL-7 and increasing anti-CD3 levels

	 IL-7 along with thymic stromal lymphopoietin seem to be necessary for Treg maturation

	 T cell maturation seems to be stunted by IL-7 in HIV infection women
	 	This effect seems magnified when patients are coinfected with HCV, as HCV seems to increase circulating IL-7
	 		this is in contrast to other data suggesting IL-7 restores T cell diversity

	IL-7 has been demonstrated to enhance thymocyte viability
		IL-7 has anti-apoptotic effects which involve BCL-2 associated X protein (BAX) which is part of the BCL-2 gene family
		B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) has also been shown to decrease in IL-7 deficient mice, which later caused increased apoptosis
			BCL2 transgene expression in IL-7R deficient mice resulted in restoration of mature T-cells
		regulatory role IL-7 plays in apoptosis via changes to the BCL2 family.

	IL-7 appears to be necessary for proper T-cell receptor γ locus rearrangement
		It appears as if the regulation of this rearrangement occurs through STAT5 histone acetylation

### Tumor
	IL-7 presents antitumor effects in tumors such as glioma, melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma

	besides the studies suggesting that IL-7 might have a potential anti-tumor effect, some other studies indicate that IL-7 might also have potential pro-tumor effects. There does appear to be effects IL-7 has on preventing apoptosis by regulating the BCL2 gene family, namely BCL2 Associated X protein (BAX), in lung cancer and thus promoting its proliferation.

## Interleukin-7 protects against bacterial respiratory infection by promoting IL-17A-producing innate T-cell response

[source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31628425/)

Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a critical cytokine in B- and T-lymphocyte development and maturation. Recent evidence suggests that IL-7 is a preferential homeostatic and survival factor for RORγt+ innate T cells such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, γδT cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in the periphery. Given the important contribution of these populations in antibacterial immunity at barrier sites, we questioned whether IL-7 could be instrumental in boosting the local host immune response against respiratory bacterial infection. By using a cytokine-monoclonal antibody approach, we illustrated a role for topical IL-7 delivery in increasing the pool of RORγt+ IL-17A-producing innate T cells. Prophylactic IL-7 treatment prior to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection led to better bacterial containment, a process associated with increased neutrophilia and that depended on γδT cells and IL-17A. Last, combined delivery of IL-7 and α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a potent agonist for invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, conferred an almost total protection in terms of survival, an effect associated with enhanced IL-17 production by innate T cells and neutrophilia. Collectively, we provide a proof of concept that IL-7 enables fine-tuning of innate T- cell functions. This might pave the way for considering IL-7 as an innovative biotherapeutic against bacterial infection.
